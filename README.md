# TE_TEnmo_app

The second of our capstones where we learned to use API, server side models, SQL commands, DAOs, controllers, as well as client side DAOs and more OOP. You are able to create accounts, verify those accounts on the server, send TE money, look at transactions and more. While in code review we discovered some interesting bugs, such as allowing postman to make transfers between accounts even when logged in as a different user. Lots more to finish here!
